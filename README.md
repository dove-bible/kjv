### Why KJV from TBS?

There are many digital KJV, however, none of them are same:

- [KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/King-James-Version-KJV-Bible/) on BibleGateway.com
- [AKJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/Authorized-King-James-Version-AKJV-Bible/), on BibleGateway.com
- [BRG](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/BRG-Bible/) on BibleGateway.com, Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition of KJV
- [KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/BRG-Bible/) on bibles.org, British and Foreign Bible Society
- [KJV](https://www.bible.com/versions/1), YouVersion

And none of them contain cross references. When I read [King James Version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Version) on Wikipedia, then I read [Settings of the King James Bible](http://www.ourkjv.com/KJB.pdf) from [Our KJV](http://www.ourkjv.com/), then I know [Trinitarian Bible Society](https://tbsbibles.org/), and choose KJV from Trinitarian Bible Society.
